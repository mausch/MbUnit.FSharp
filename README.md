MbUnit.FSharp
=============

F# DSL for first-class [MbUnit](http://www.gallio.org/) tests

This project gives you a few simple functions to facilitate handling MbUnit tests as [first-class values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen) in F#.

See some self-explanatory examples [here](https://github.com/mausch/MbUnit.FSharp/blob/master/MbUnit.FSharp.Sample/Tests.fs).
